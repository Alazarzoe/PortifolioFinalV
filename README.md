# This app is portifolio/resume app

The app have simple and interactive UI for the user and it shows detail info of the person and the socia media link redirected to the specified url.

I have used OOP concept to make the app simple and maintainable for future use.

I have created my own UI and I build that.

I have used 'url_launcher' package to implement the social media links.

If I had more time, I have some feature in my mind like adding sign up feature,adding into DB feature for many users,{add,filter and remove,update resume features}, changing language for different languages,
